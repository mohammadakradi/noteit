# Noteit

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Developer Notes

__Used Libraries:__
* Angular Material

__Need to Improve:__
* Designing a unique not found page (404) for the project to display for not existing routes
* Not allowing the client to update a note if no changes have been applied
* Writing directive for category in note-card to display different categories with different background color
* Enhance UI/UX
